📝 AI's Correction Report
Errors Identified:

Reported zero values for all payment and income metrics despite the presence of eight payment debits in the dataset.
Applied an incorrect filter requiring negative amounts instead of using the 'type' field ('debit') to identify outflows; all provided amounts are positive but marked as 'debit'.
Over-restricted inclusion to lender_payment=true for total_monthly_payments, which excluded valid payments (e.g., Paymentech) that should count toward total monthly payments even if lender_payment=false.
Failed to recognize repeating daily debits from JNG Capital as a daily position pattern, leading to 0 positions reported.
Provided 0 bank accounts without flagging that account-level identifiers were missing in the dataset; did not attempt alternative inference or explicitly mark the limitation.
Set average_monthly_income, annual_income, holdback_percentage, and monthly_payment_to_income_pct to 0 instead of marking them as not computable from a dataset that only contains debits (no deposits/revenue).
Missed Transactions:

Orig CO Name:Jngcapital Desc Date:250331 CO Entry: $906.25 - Dropped by incorrect negative-amount filter; amount is positive but 'type'='debit' and should have been included.
Orig CO Name:Paymentech Desc Date:250402 CO Entry: $1,958.33 - Dropped by two faulty filters: (1) negative-amount requirement; (2) over-restricting to lender_payment=true. Despite lender_payment=false, it is a 'payment' debit and should have been included in total monthly payments.

Miscategorized Transactions:

Orig CO Name:Paymentech Desc Date:250402 CO Entry: Was 'Excluded due to lender_payment=false', Should be 'Included in total_monthly_payments because it is a 'payment' debit, regardless of lender_payment flag'
Recurring 'Orig CO Name:Jngcapital' debits (seven entries at 906.25): Was 'Excluded by negative-amount filter, positions not recognized', Should be 'Counted in total_monthly_payments and flagged as a daily MCA position (repeating business-day debits from JNG Capital)'
Detailed Explanation:

What went wrong: The analysis pipeline incorrectly relied on negative amounts to detect debits instead of using the explicit 'type' field. All provided transactions have positive amounts, but they are clearly marked as 'type'='debit', so they were mistakenly excluded. In addition, the logic over-constrained total_monthly_payments to lender_payment=true, which wrongly excluded valid payment debits like the Paymentech ACH. We also failed to identify positions by clustering repeating origin names, so the daily JNG Capital pattern was missed. Finally, metrics that require revenue/deposit data (average_monthly_income, annual_income, holdback_percentage, monthly_payment_to_income_pct) were set to 0 instead of being marked as not computable from a debit-only subset. Reconciliation within provided data: The exact transactions that should have been counted (and were previously missed) total 8,302.08 for the period shown: seven JNG Capital debits at 906.25 each (6,343.75) plus one Paymentech debit at 1,958.33. These account for the difference between our prior

 aymentscannotbereconciledfromtheprovideddataandwasincorrectlyreportedas0.00 without noting data insufficiency. Likewise, the very large human-reported monthly/annual income and holdback figures are not derivable from this dataset because there are no deposit/credit entries here. How to prevent this: (1) Use the 'type' field to determine cash flow direction; do not rely on sign alone. (2) For total_monthly_payments, include all 'payment' category debits regardless of lender_payment flag; reserve lender_payment=true for the lender-specific subset. (3) Implement pattern detection for positions by grouping recurring ACH origin names and fixed amounts across consecutive business days (daily), weekly intervals (weekly), or monthly cycles. (4) When required inputs for a metric are missing (e.g., income requires credits/deposits), return 'insufficient data' rather than 0. (5) Add unit tests that include positive-amount debits and non-lender payment debits to ensure filters do not erroneously exclude them.
